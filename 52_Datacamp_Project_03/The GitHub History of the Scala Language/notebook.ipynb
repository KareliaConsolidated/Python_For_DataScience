Is there camaraderie in the project?\n<p>The organizational structure varies from one project to another, and it can influence your success as a contributor. A project that has a very small community might not be the best one to start working on. The small community might indicate a high barrier of entry. This can be caused by several factors, including a community that is reluctant to accept pull requests from \"outsiders,\" that the code base is hard to work with, etc. However, a large community can serve as an indicator that the project is regularly accepting pull requests from new contributors. Such a project would be a good place to start.</p>\n<p>In order to evaluate the dynamics of the community, we will plot a histogram of the number of pull requests submitted by each user.
